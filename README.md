NOTE

build is very early (i coded it in 8 hours)

yea it is coded in python in 240 lines of code (pretty big)

but here is all of the commands:

bonjour -> must be at the start of the program

au revoir -> must be at the end of the program

talktotheseniour>INSIDE TEXT HERE OR  VARIABLES< -> print text, can handle variables

baguette example = 0 -> create int variable
tea liters example = 0.0 -> create float variable
clever joke example = "" -> create string variable
vrai example = False/True -> create boolean variable
the eiffel tower example = ["test", 0, 0.0, True] -> create list

imagine(condition) -> if statement
wakebacktoreality -> declares loop end or if statement end
or else -> else in if statement
OR -> simple or that can be used in conditions
AND -> simple and that can be used in conditions

make tea until (condition) -> while loop


hope someone sees it :)
